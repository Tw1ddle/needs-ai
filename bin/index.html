			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<p>This page uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_system" target="_blank">utility AI</a> to control autonomous agents in the game world. In this demo we have humans and zombies - humans have a problem with zombies, and zombies enjoy nothing more than eating brains. Use the mouse to interact and watch the chaos unfold.</p>
			<p>AI where NPCs consider their own needs leads to convincing awareness of their environments and emergent autonomous behaviour without the need for brittle scripting. Utility based AI works for many types of game. Implementations tend to be modular, extensible and reusable, and are used in various commercial games, such as Iron Man or Red Dead Redemption.</p>
			<p>This implementation has the following structure: AI agents have Brains, top level decision makers that direct an agent. Brains contain Reasoners, decision makers that assess the suitability of sets of actions. Reasoners contain ActionSets, groups of potential actions. ActionSets contain Actions, identifiers for actions that an agent can engage in. Actions (also known as Options) contain Considerations, aspects that an agent must assess to determine the suitability of an action. Finally, each Consideration (also known as an Axis) holds an Input, a measurable aspect of the game world, and a technique an agent uses to consider (evaluate) the Input.</p>
			<p>When it is time for an agent to think using their Brain(s), the Actions are scored by evaluating their associated Considerations, and the best scoring actions are chosen through a strategy encapsulated by the ActionSets and Reasoners.</p>
			<p>A single agent may have more than one Brain for handling separate sets of Actions that may be performed in parallel, such as one Brain for chattering with your fellow survivors, and others for core behaviours such as handling weapons or running from zombies.</p>
			<p>The most challenging part of using a utility based AI is the amount of design work and balancing needed to produce the behaviour you want. For example, an Input such as the distance from zombies must factor into human Considerations, but it may depend on the person.</p>
			<p>Another challenging area is making Inputs, views of interesting data about your world, available in an efficient way. Such as, how to represent generalized distances between objects, influence maps, elapsed times and other attributes. Scalability is simple though - you can perform triggered updates, have agents only use their Brains every so often, or even disallow Actions that take a lot of processing power to consider when necessary.</p>
