			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<p>This page uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_system" target="_blank">utility AI</a> to manage humans who "cooperate" against a horde of zombies. It's inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Panic!_Source" target="_blank">Zombie Panic</a> Source.</p>
			<p>Utility AI, where NPCs consider their own needs, produces agents that exhibit emergent autonomous behaviour and awareness of their environments, without the need for brittle scripting. The approach can be applied in many kinds of game. Implementations tend to be extensible and reusable, and are used in various commercial games, such as The Sims, Iron Man and Red Dead Redemption.</p>
			<p>This <a href="https://github.com/Tw1ddle/needs-ai" target="_blank">implementation</a> takes the following approach: AI agents have Brains. Brains are top-level decision makers that tell agents what they should try to do. Brains contain Reasoners, these encapsulate logic for assessing the suitability of sets of game actions. Reasoners contain ActionSets, groups of actions. ActionSets consist of Actions, identifiers for actual activities that an agent can engage in the game. Actions (also known as Options) contain Considerations, aspects that an agent must assess to decide whether to perform a game action. Finally, each Consideration (also known as an Axis) references an Input, a measurable aspect of the game world, and a technique for considering (evaluating) the Input.</p>
			<p>When it is time to update the AI, an agent thinks using their Brain(s). The best scoring actions are chosen through a strategy encapsulated by the Reasoners and ActionSets within the Brains, with individual Actions being scored by evaluating their associated Considerations.</p>
			<p>A single agent can have more than one Brain. This is for handling separate sets of Actions that may be performed in parallel, like walking and talking. In this demo, humans have one Brain for chattering with fellow survivors and taunting zombies, and another for core behaviours, such as handling weapons or fleeing from zombies.</p>
			<p>Needs based AI requires careful design and balancing needed to produce the behaviours you want. For example, a human who has to decide whether to flee the undead would have a Consideration based on the number of zombies in the vicinity, but how the Brain processes that information depends on where other survivors are, and how cowardly the survivor in question is.</p>
			<p>Another area of interest is making Inputs (views of data about your world) available in an efficient way. You often need to provide generalized distances between objects, influence maps, elapsed times and other attributes. Scalability is easy to handle - you can perform triggered updates, make agents only use their Brains every so often, disallow Actions that take a lot of work to consider, or even tell agents to think less when processing power is in short supply.</p>
