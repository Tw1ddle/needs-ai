[Demo](https://tw1ddle.github.io/needs-ai/index.html) of the [Needs AI](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/needs-ai-lib) utility-based AI library.

*Note: this demo is unfinished and isn't much use for anything, since I shelved my utility AI library project.*

## Notes
* Written using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), including shaders based on the threejs dynamic terrain example.
