Almighty father, guide my aim!
Finger on the trigger buddy, cover me
Fire!
Eat this!
Freakin' kill them already!
You're going below ground for good!
With righteous fire I shall purge you!
Get ready!
We've got company!
Gun them down!
Here they come!
How 'bout this!?
Waste 'em!
Took your ass, sucka!
Time to die!
Try me bro, try me!
Suck on this!
Shoot them brain dawgs!
Send 'em back to hell!
It's time for you to die!
Kill 'em all!
Knock 'em down!
Put 'em down!
Shoot 'em!
Shoot shoot shoot!!!
Shoot them!
Show them who's boss brother!
Ooooh, smoke 'em!
Open fire!
No mercy!
Light 'em up!
Look out, they're coming!
Oh my God - here they come!
