Damn, I'm still alive
Damn, that was easier than I thought!
Damn, we made it!
Gather the dead, burn the bodies
Hahahaha, that's the way to do it!
Hahahahaha, target practice!
Hahahahaha, that was too easy.
God was with us with this battle!
God, that was too freaking close!
We're finished here, let's burn the bodies
Victory is ours brothers!
Until next time, Satan!
Hah, they're all dead!
Let's drink, to us - the zombie destroyers!
Hah, I think we got them all!
That's the last of 'em, thank God
