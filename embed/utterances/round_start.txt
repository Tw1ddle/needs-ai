Are you guys sure about this? This place looks strange...
We better sweep this area real close.
Whose stupid-ass idea was it to come here anyway?
God protects his faithful! But... just in case, watch my back!
Dude... what're we doing here?
Gather your courage, companions! We're up to our necks in undead!
Wait, wait, did y'all hear that? Lock and load!
This place is no good, let's go!
This place is too quiet, we shouldn't stay here long
Hush, did you hear that!? I think we're being followed
Somethin's about to go down! Let's move out!
Something ain't right, let's clear the area!
Someone or something is here and it ain't one of us!
I don't like this place... let's look around and make sure it's safe.
I think coming here was a mistake, we should go back...
It's getting late, we need to find shelter!
Oh man... it doesn't look like we were the first ones here guys.
I've got a real bad feeling about this place...
There's gotta be supplies around here, let's split up and find them
These supplies ain't gonna cut it, maybe there are more weapons around here...
If we fail, I'm coming back for you...!
